### [Picture glance](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/lovelace_card_types.html#picture-glance)

Picture glance is an even more useful type of card that can display sensors, switches, lights and other entities grouped on top of a custom image. Use for this card are for easy recognition inside a large dashboard. What really sets this card apart is the ability to **control** entities directly from the card without the need to open the details of that entity.

> Picture glance supports a display of maximum 10 items (thanks to @jackjohnsonuk)
